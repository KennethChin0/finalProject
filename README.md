## Description of Project  
We are making our attempt of creating the popular child's game hangman.
The objective of the game is to guess a word that sthe computer randomly generates. The
guessers guess a letter each turn. If the letter is part of the word, the
position the letter is in the word is shown, else a part of a drawing of a stick
figure is drawn (representative of certain number of lives). Our game is two players so each 
player will take turns guessing, who ever guess first wins!


## How to run
To run our project, open two terminal windows/tabs. Then run the program on both
terminals. Instructions on how to play will be displayed. Take turns guess the
work against another player.


## Resources
We used a txt file to store our words taken from Github user Xethron which can be found here:
